## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- React
- Vite
- Clerk (for authentication)
- Custom UI components
- TypeScript

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction)
- Socket.io (for real-time communication)
- Cloudinary (for media storage)
- `spotify-clone` dependency (local dependency, purpose unclear without more context)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install --prefix backend
    npm install --prefix frontend
    ```

3.  Configure environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory. You'll need to define environment variables for:
      - MongoDB connection string
      - Clerk API keys
      - Cloudinary API keys
      - Other sensitive information

    Refer to the `.env.example` (if available, not provided) or the backend code for the specific environment variables required.

4.  Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev --prefix backend
    ```

5.  Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev --prefix frontend
    ```

## Usage

- **Authentication:** Sign in with Google using the provided OAuth button.
- **Admin Interface:** Access the admin interface (the route is not clear from the provided files, look in the frontend code).
